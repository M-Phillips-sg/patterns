### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns are design for class instantiation and object creation, they concern themselves with how classes and objects are created. They help introduce stability and reduce complexity when instantiating new objects.

There are 5 creational patterns:

- [singleton]({{< ref "./singleton/" >}})
- [builder]({{< ref "./builder/" >}})
- factory
- abstract factory
- prototype
