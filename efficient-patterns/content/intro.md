title: What is a Pattern
---

**Patterns** are design level solutions for solving common problems that software engineers come across on a frequent basis. The design patterns themsevles are not code but rather describe how to tackle a given problem using a tried and tested design.

Using a pattern is considered to be a good practice, these patterns have been field tested and found to work, even as an application becomes more complex, these patterns continue to function as designed. Typically patterns are associated with OOP languages such as Java and are used extensively in frameworks like SpringBoot.

However many of the patterns are applicable to JavaScript / Typescript.
